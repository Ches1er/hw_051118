                       The party was even projected to gain more seats than in 2006, the year they delivered what then-President George W. Bush described as a “thumping.”",
            "Republican Brian Kemp on Tuesday was leading Democrat Stacey Abrams in a bitter contest to become Georgia’s next governor.
                           Abrams was seeking to become the first African-American woman elected governor in American history, but trailed by three points with 97 percent of the vote counted.
                            In an impassioned speech to supporters at 1:30 a.m., Abrams refused to concede, suggesting that the race might go to a runoff. Voters will get a “do-over,” she promised."
